# **British Museum Collection: Shell of Glycymeris nummaria (Museum Number: 2012,5015.1)**
This object, registered under museum number 2012,5015.1, is a marine shell of the species Glycymeris nummaria (historically identified in records as Pectunculus zonalis). It was excavated by the archaeologist Sir Flinders Petrie at the site of Naukratis in Egypt and is currently held in the British Museum's collection. While this specific specimen was collected from a later historical context, the species itself serves as a vital reference point for understanding how early humans interacted with and utilized marine resources across different eras.

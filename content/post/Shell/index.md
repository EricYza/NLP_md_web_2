# **The Significance of Glycymeris Shell Ornaments in Early Human Symbolic Behavior**
Research into the origins of human modernities has identified Glycymeris shells as some of the earliest known personal ornaments used by Homo sapiens. Evidence from the Qafzeh Cave in Israel reveals that these shells were collected and perforated to be worn as beads approximately 120 thousand years (120,000 years) ago. The discovery of these shells in layers dating back 120,000 years—often found with traces of red ochre—proves that early humans were engaged in symbolic representation and social signaling far earlier than previously thought, using these specific mollusks as a medium for identity.

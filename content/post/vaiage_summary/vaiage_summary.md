# Purpose
The system is designed for planning trips — which involves many moving parts: user preferences, dates, destinations, budget, weather, group size, etc. The authors observe that many existing travel‐planning tools produce static results and lack adaptability (e.g., when constraints or user intent change). 

Thus, the goal of **Vaiage** is to provide a more adaptive, interactive, and personalised travel‐planning solution via a multi‐agent framework built on large language models (LLMs).

# Main Functions & Components
## Here are the main functions of Vaiage and how they map to its components:
### User intent inference & preferences elicitation


Vaiage uses an LLM to infer user goals, preferences and constraints (destination, budget, travel style, group size, timing etc.).


It supports conversational interaction — the user can refine their intent, clarify constraints, update preferences.


This helps the system personalise the result rather than using a one‐size‐fits‐all package.


### Recommendation of destinations/activities


Given the user's intent and constraints, the system recommends personalised destinations and activities aligned with those preferences.


It also accounts for contextual and external information like weather, timing, group size, budget constraints.


### Sequential planning / itinerary synthesis


After gathering preferences and recommendations, the system generates an end-to-end itinerary. That means it sequences the various components of the trip: e.g., travel to destination, stay/accommodation, activities each day, timing between activities, etc.


The itinerary is designed to satisfy constraints (budget, time, group size) and be feasible (i.e., temporally and spatially coherent).


### Multi‐agent coordination with structured tool use & feedback loops


The system is architected as a graph‐structured multi‐agent framework: different agents (each powered by LLMs) undertake different roles (for example: strategy agent, information agent) and coordinate.


They make use of external tools/APIs (e.g., for retrieving real-time data like weather, map info, opening hours, prices for hotels, fuel prices). 


A map‐based feedback loop allows checking spatial/temporal feasibility (e.g., travel times between activities).


The coordination enables the system to adapt if constraints change or additional information becomes available.


Adaptive & explainable planning


Because the agents use LLMs, the system supports natural‐language interaction: users can ask questions, refine their intent, the system can explain its reasoning.


The system adapts to changes: if user changes budget, date, group size, the plan can be updated.


The paper emphasizes explainability and end‐to‐end planning (not just recommending one activity).


Evaluation & performance metrics


The system was evaluated in human‐in‐the‐loop experiments (with rubric‐based assessment via GPT-4 and qualitative feedback). It also use the TravelPlanner Benchmark to evaluate the plans, which makes sure the plans are feasible.


They show that the full system scored on average 8.5/10, outperforming variants missing strategy agent (7.2) or external API (6.8).



# Summary of How It Works (Workflow)
## Putting the functions together, a rough workflow is:
User engages in conversational interface → provides travel goals, preferences, constraints.


The system (via an “intent” or “preference” agent) interprets user input → extracts structured representation of preferences.


A “strategy” agent devises planning strategy: e.g., pick destination, allocate days, select activities, filter by constraints.


An “information” or “data” agent retrieves external real‐time/contextual data: weather, location information, travel time, opening hours, etc.


The system synthesises these into an itinerary: sequences of activities, timing, transport, accommodation, etc.


It presents the plan to the user in natural language, and the user can ask refinements or modifications.


If the user changes something (e.g., budget, date), the system adapts: some agents revisit their tasks, update the plan accordingly.


The system supports explainability: it can articulate its reasoning (why certain activities were chosen, how travel times were considered, etc.).



# Distinctive Features (Functions Compared to Prior Tools)
- **Dynamic adaptation:** Rather than static suggestions, the system supports multi‐turn interaction and adapts the plan as user intent or constraints evolve.


- **Multi‐agent orchestration:** Specialized agents coordinate rather than a monolithic model; this helps distribute complexity (recommendation, information retrieval, strategy).


- **Real-time/contextual awareness:** Incorporates tools/APIs for external data (weather, map/travel times) to ensure the plan is feasible in real world.


- **Explainability and conversational interface:** Users can engage via natural language, ask clarifications, refine preferences, and get explained reasoning.


- **End-to-end itinerary generation:** Not just recommending “destination + top attractions”, but fully sequencing the trip (days/activities/timing) under constraints.
